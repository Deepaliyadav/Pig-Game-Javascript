GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- The final score is entered by the players in the "FINAL SCORE" input box (which is in the bottom of the game) 
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach the Final score (if the Final score is not decided then by default they have to score 100 points) on GLOBAL score wins the game
